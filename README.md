## Rules:
First, the player needs to set the amount of playes in the game.
In each turn of player X there is a calculation and the current player gets the first cell with the minimum number of possible values to set in that cell.
Every player will try to insert numbers to cells in order to fill the board.
Each insertion of number to a cell needs to be considered with following rules:
 - Only the numbers from 1 through to 9 can be used.
 - Every square has to contain a single number.
 - Each row must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
 - Each column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9, without repetitions
 - Each 3Ã—3 box can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
